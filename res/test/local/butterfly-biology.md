## Anatomy of a Butterfly

### Wings

Butterflies are known for their large, colorful wings. The wings are made up of thin layers of chitin, the same protein that makes up the exoskeleton of a butterfly. The colors of the wings are created by the reflection and refraction of light by the microscopic scales that cover them.

### Body

The body of a butterfly is divided into three parts: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. The head houses the eyes, antennae, and proboscis. The thorax contains the muscles that control the wings. The abdomen contains the digestive and reproductive organs.

## Life Cycle of a Butterfly

The butterfly has a most interesting life cycle.

### Caterpillar Stage

The life cycle of a butterfly begins as an egg. From the egg hatches the caterpillar, or larva. The caterpillar spends most of its time eating, growing rapidly and shedding its skin several times.

### Chrysalis Stage

Once the caterpillar has grown enough, it forms a chrysalis, or pupa. Inside the chrysalis, the caterpillar undergoes a transformation called metamorphosis. Over the course of a few weeks, it reorganizes its body and emerges as a butterfly.
