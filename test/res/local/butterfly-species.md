# Butterfly Species

Butterflies are insects in the macrolepidopteran clade Rhopalocera from the order Lepidoptera, which also includes moths. There are about 20,000 species of butterflies worldwide. This document will describe a few notable ones.

## Monarch Butterfly

### Overview

The Monarch butterfly, also known as Danaus plexippus, is perhaps the most well-known of all North American butterflies. It's known for its incredible mass migration that brings millions of them to California and Mexico each winter.

### Appearance

Monarch butterflies are bright orange with black and white markings. Their wingspan ranges from 3.5 to 4 inches, making them one of the larger butterfly species.

## Swallowtail Butterfly

### Overview

Swallowtail butterflies are large, colorful butterflies that form the family Papilionidae. There are over 550 species, and though the majority are tropical, members of the family inhabit every continent except Antarctica.

### Appearance

Swallowtails are easily recognizable by their distinctive wing shape: the back end of the wing has a long, tail-like extension, similar to the forked tail of some swallows (hence the name).

## Blue Morpho Butterfly

### Overview

Blue Morpho butterflies are among the largest butterflies in the world, with wings spanning from five to eight inches. They are found in the tropical rainforests of Latin America from Mexico to Colombia.

### Appearance

Blue Morpho butterflies are known for their striking blue color. The brilliant blue color in the butterfly's wings is caused by the diffraction of the light from millions of tiny scales on its wings.

## Painted Lady Butterfly

### Overview

The Painted Lady butterfly, Vanessa cardui, is one of the most widespread of all butterfly species. It's found on every continent except Antarctica and South America.

### Appearance

The Painted Lady butterfly has a wingspan of 2 to 3 inches. Its wings have a complex pattern of brown, orange, and black, with four conspicuous eye-spots on the hind wings.
